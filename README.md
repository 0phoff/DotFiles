# 0phoff's Personal DotFiles
This repo contains my personal dotfiles.  
Feel free to look around, copy and redistribute at your own will!  
I would not recomend blindly taking over my dotfiles, as they contain quite a lot of aliasses, vim mappings, etc. It is always better to build your own dotfiles!

## Different Files Explained
Like a lot of people, I keep all my dotfiles in a separate folder and create symlinks at the places where they should be.  

  - Bash:     In this directory you can find my bashrc as well as other scripts I link to /usr/local/bin
  - Tmux:     This folder contains my tmux configuration
  - Vim:      This folder contains my Vim configuration. I use neovim, so that's a thing to consider...
  - Keyboard: This folder contains some xkb settings for my keyboard
